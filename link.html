        <h1 id="section1">Next, install the Python interpreter on your computer. 
            This is the program that reads Python programs and carries 
            out their instructions; you need it before you can do any 
            Python programming. Mac OSX distributions from 10.3 (Panther)
             and up include a version of Python, which may be suitable 
             for beginning despite being as much as two years out of date.
              Linux distributions also frequently include Python,
               which is readily upgraded.

        <h2 id="section2">Most tutorials assume that you know how to run a program on 
            your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, 
            see How do I Run a Program Under Windows. There are also sites 
            that offer in-browser coding for those who want to learn Python: 
            see Codecademy for general python and DataCamp or Dataquest 
            for Python for data science. Print a cheat sheet of the most 
            important Python features and post it to your office wall 
            until you know the basics well.
